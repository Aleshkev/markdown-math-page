This is a build system for math-filled documents.

I mainly use it to create notes, references, and write up problems, for university math courses. Everything is styled to easily be printed/saved to PDF, so that it can pass as content created with LaTeX.

Uses
- Astro (with Tailwind, TypeScript)
- Markdown
- Asciimath (soon to be replaced?) because LaTeX is slow to type
